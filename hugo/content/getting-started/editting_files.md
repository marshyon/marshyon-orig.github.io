### General working 

If you have a user account already permitted access to push to this particular repository there is very little to do other than to check out this repo and edit and push new content. The process of re-rendering the site as new content is submitted is handled in a pipeline.

If you dont have this and want to do this yourself, see [this article](/getting-started/cloning_this_repository_and_regenerating_the_site_locally/) for how that can be simply achieved using `hugo`

### Adding a new article and editing its contents

in the `hugo/content` directory, there are subdirectories that each have articles within them. 

It can be easiest to copy one of these files to a new filename of the article you want to publish.

Then simply edit the newly copied file, being careful to edit the 'metadata' at the top of the file, for example this article has metadata as follows :

```
---
title: "Editing files"
date: 2020-11-09T15:43:00+01:00
draft: false
weight: 2
---
```

After this meta data at the top of the file, just type any content as normal text and using `markdown` to highlight headings, bold, italic etc

for example

```
# heading level 1
## heading level 2
### heading level 3
```

a code block can be inserted starting with 3 back-ticks : ``` 

```
PS>$PSVersionTable

and terminated with ``` three back-ticks

### 

### Images

Images that you want to display need to be stored as image files in the `hugo/static/image` folder or subdirectories that are created within this and then linked to in your markdown.

the following markdown will show an image stored in static/images :

```
![penguins](/images/penguins_scaled.png)
```

![penguins](/images/penguins_scaled.png)
