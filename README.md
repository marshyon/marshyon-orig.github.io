# Quick setup of a Hugo Learn theme site

The hugo site is to be found in the `docs` directory.

To try out this site yourself, clone this repo and cd into the `docs` directory and 

* edit `congig.toml` accordingly to suit your intended site name
* run `hugo serve -b http://localhost:1313` to serve the content locally 

hugo can be downloaded from [hugo releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases)
