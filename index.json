	"content": " 2020 In this year we find ourselves in a tremendously new, unfamiliar, strange, sometimes confusing and even exciting new world of technology and directions that once only a few years ago would seem impossible even implausable.\nOver 20 years ago I started to specialise in open source, specifically Linux based services and systems. I did this as I refuse to use pirated software and although I have no objection to using and paying for licensed software, I could not at the time justify the high cost of commercial software supplied by the likes of Microsoft and other giants.\nToday and over the recent weeks / months I have spent an increasingly longer time using Microsoft web based documentation which features not windows software but Azure hosted open source tools and materials.\nAll that time ago, and starting out as a systems administrator the organisations I worked for did not allocate much if any budget to the function I performed so asking for a few hundred quid ( uk pounds ) to purchase a license for some suite of tools just so I could learn pascal was not going to happen.\nThere was then an environment of fear uncertainty and doubt surrounding open source and indeed a general mood of contempt for such things from Microsoft and others in the industry.\nSo blow it, I chose open source and have not looked back. I can’t say I’ve loved every moment of it since but learning was frankly easier, particularly as all of the software I needed was free to use under open source license and also as from the early days back in 1990 something you could get information freely on open source software and tools that you wanted to learn. Meantime Microsoft and others were charging considerable amounts of cash for training materials and documentation.\nI’m not intending to bash on Microsoft, even though they surely deserve it for the bad things they have done to the Linux community in the past but I’m not interested in getting the final word either. I am now as before, a pragmatist and will use the right tools for the right job and at the right cost.\nHow things have changed though, now Microsoft ‘loves Linux’ and if we don’t want to believe that, Azure it is said hosts over 60% Linux based servers and applications. On a recent project I’ve worked on, dotnet core developers were delivering C# code compiled on Linux based pipelines and hosted as Linux web applications. The ‘dotnet core’ application platform they inform me is moving further away from traditional .NET than ever before, soon to have little or no backwards compatibility with it’s Windows roots.\nAt a recent Microsoft training event that I attended we were presented for a whole day with tools hosted on Azure that are wholly Linux based solutions, Kubernetes, Docker, I even saw a Microsoft person using Vim.\nAnd I could go on. It would seem that the recent turn around of Microsoft’s financial status would coincide with their new direction and possibly new CEO Satya Nadella who took over from Steve Ballmer in 2014. I wonder what Steve and Bill think of what he’s done and if they’ve changed their minds on certain things now ?\n"

This is only fair in my view, after all, this is a free service so we cant really complain.\nConigure Hugo for use in Github.io hosting Create a new directory structure to host your new git account with the following :\n. ├── hugo_site └── README.md  where hugo_site is a directory that will hold your hugo site and README.md contains a description of your site and project\nInitialise your git repository locally following the instructions given by github when you created the new repository.\nCopy or move the hugo site you created with getting started installation into the hugo_site directory.\nHugo uses a config.toml file to configure the creation of your static site so this needs to be changed to have the following values :\nbaseURL = \u0026quot;https://your_git_user_name.github.io\u0026quot; publishDir = \u0026quot;..\u0026quot;  replacing your_git_user_name with your own git user name\nensure that all of your hugo pages have\ndraft: false  in their meta data or have this line removed then change directory to your hugo_site directory and run :\nhugo  You should find that your site code is generated in the directory above hugo_site.\nCommit to git your additions and changes then push the git content to see the site available at github.io.\nWorking with new content the following can be used to run a dynamically loaded site on localhost port 1313 :\nhugo serve -b http://localhost:1313  This over rides the github address now in config.toml and permits you to preview changes before again running hugo to update / git commit and push your generated content.\n"

The following focuses on the use of a private registry hosted in Azure.\nTo follow the procedure outlined below the following prerequisites will need to be installed :\n Docker azure cli Go  Pretty much all that follows is run from a bash shell under Linux, Mac or Ubuntu sub system for windows. The command \u0026lsquo;jq\u0026rsquo; will be used and if it is not already installed it will also be needed :\nsudo apt install jq  With the az command installed, it is also assumed that there is already an Azure account available and that this is authenticated and ready to use with\naz login  The following is the server.go file\npackage main import ( \u0026quot;context\u0026quot; \u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot; \u0026quot;log\u0026quot; \u0026quot;net/http\u0026quot; \u0026quot;os\u0026quot; \u0026quot;os/signal\u0026quot; \u0026quot;syscall\u0026quot; \u0026quot;time\u0026quot; \u0026quot;github.com/gorilla/mux\u0026quot; \u0026quot;gopkg.in/natefinch/lumberjack.v2\u0026quot; ) func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { query := r.URL.Query() name := query.Get(\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;) if name == \u0026quot;\u0026quot; { name = \u0026quot;Guest\u0026quot; } log.Printf(\u0026quot;Received request for %s\\n\u0026quot;, name) w.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf(\u0026quot;Hello, %s\\n\u0026quot;, name))) } func main() { // Create Server and Route Handlers r := mux.NewRouter() r.HandleFunc(\u0026quot;/\u0026quot;, handler) srv := \u0026amp;http.Server{ Handler: r, Addr: \u0026quot;:8080\u0026quot;, ReadTimeout: 10 * time.Second, WriteTimeout: 10 * time.Second, } // Configure Logging LOG_FILE_LOCATION := os.Getenv(\u0026quot;LOG_FILE_LOCATION\u0026quot;) if LOG_FILE_LOCATION != \u0026quot;\u0026quot; { log.SetOutput(\u0026amp;lumberjack.Logger{ Filename: LOG_FILE_LOCATION, MaxSize: 500, // megabytes MaxBackups: 3, MaxAge: 28, //days Compress: true, // disabled by default }) } // Start Server go func() { log.Println(\u0026quot;Starting Server\u0026quot;) if err := srv.ListenAndServe(); err != nil { log.Fatal(err) } }() // Graceful Shutdown waitForShutdown(srv) } func waitForShutdown(srv *http.Server) { interruptChan := make(chan os.Signal, 1) signal.Notify(interruptChan, os.Interrupt, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM) // Block until we receive our signal. \u0026lt;-interruptChan // Create a deadline to wait for. ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second*10) defer cancel() srv.Shutdown(ctx) log.Println(\u0026quot;Shutting down\u0026quot;) os.Exit(0) }  The following is the Dockerfile which will be used to build a new docker image based on the Go application above\nFROM golang:latest as builder # Add Maintainer Info LABEL maintainer=\u0026quot;Jon Brookes \u0026lt;marshyon@gmail.com\u0026gt;\u0026quot; # Set the Current Working Directory inside the container WORKDIR /app # Copy go mod and sum files COPY go.mod go.sum ./ # Download all dependencies.

Begin by creating your first chapter page with the following command\nhugo new --kind chapter basics/_index.md  By opening the given file, you should see the property chapter=true on top, meaning this page is a chapter.\nBy default all chapters and pages are created as a draft.

Here are two ways to create content in the chapter:\nhugo new basics/first-content.md hugo new basics/second-content/_index.md  Feel free to edit thoses files by adding some sample content and replacing the title value in the beginning of the files.\nLaunching the website locally Launch by using the following command:\nhugo serve  Go to http://localhost:1313\nYou should notice three things:\n You have a left-side Basics menu, containing two submenus with names equal to the title properties in the previously created files. The home page explains how to customize it by following the instructions. When you run hugo serve, when the contents of the files change, the page automatically refreshes with the changes. Neat!
