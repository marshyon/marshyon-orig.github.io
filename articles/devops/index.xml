      <description>Prerequisites  A working K8s cluster Kubectl  see this article
Creating a test back-end service A deployment and service needs to be implemented to create :
  a pod with an application in this case called marshyon/test-node-listener - see this repo for the code behind this
  a service of type ClusterIP , the default if not specified and by its nature only available internally within the K8s cluster</description>

      <description>Simple single pod deploy and exposure of service outside of K8s using a simple test nodejs docker container at :
https://hub.docker.com/r/marshyon/test-node-container
lets create a running pod using a pre-configured application from docker hub:
kubectl run node-test --image=marshyon/test-node-container --port=8080 this can be seen to be running within k8s by getting pods in the default namespace :
kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE node-test 1/1 Running 0 9m57s to expose this to the outside world we need to expose it using a load balancer :</description>

      <title>Deploying Kubernetes Clusters to Cloud Providers</title>

      <description>K8s in any cloud platform is essentially just K8s, in that that it is still fundamentally Kubernetes &amp;lsquo;under the hood&amp;rsquo;. However there are different ways in which to deploy K8s in AWS for example as opposed to Azure, Google cloud and others.
When exposing services to the internet or rather, network sources outside that of the cluster, there are differences brought about by the way the prevailing service integrates with said exposure.</description>

      <description>Azure Web Applications can only support a limited number of languages and whilst Go was supported for a time it is no longer so as an alternative is to serve a custom Docker image with a Go web application within it, hosted on a public registry such as Docker Hub or a private one within Azure itself. The following focuses on the use of a private registry hosted in Azure.</description>
