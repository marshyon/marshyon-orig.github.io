      <description>Corona 19 Perhaps the worst viral outbreak since so called Spanish Flu of the post first world war era has reared its ugly head and torn through everyones lives, families, life styles, welfare and our very existence.

I did this as I refuse to use pirated software and although I have no objection to using and paying for licensed software, I could not at the time justify the high cost of commercial software supplied by the likes of Microsoft and other giants.</description>
