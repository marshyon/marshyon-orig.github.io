<h1 id="2020">2020</h1>

<p>In this year we find ourselves in a tremendously new, unfamiliar, strange, sometimes confusing and even exciting new world of technology and directions that once only a few years ago would seem impossible even implausable.</p>

<p>Over 20 years ago I started to specialise in open source, specifically Linux based services and systems. I did this as I refuse to use pirated software and although I have no objection to using and paying for licensed software, I could not at the time justify the high cost of commercial software supplied by the likes of Microsoft and other giants.</p>

<p>Today and over the recent weeks / months I have spent an increasingly longer time using Microsoft web based documentation which features not windows software but Azure hosted open source tools and materials.</p>

<p>All that time ago, and starting out as a systems administrator the organisations I worked for did not allocate much if any budget to the function I performed so asking for a few hundred quid ( uk pounds ) to purchase a license for some suite of tools just so I could learn pascal was not going to happen.</p>

<p>There was then an environment of fear uncertainty and doubt surrounding open source and indeed a general mood of contempt for such things from Microsoft and others in the industry.</p>

<p>So blow it, I chose open source and have not looked back. I can’t say I’ve loved every moment of it since but learning was frankly easier, particularly as all of the software I needed was free to use under open source license and also as from the early days back in 1990 something you could get information freely on open source software and tools that you wanted to learn. Meantime Microsoft and others were charging considerable amounts of cash for training materials and documentation.</p>

<p>I’m not intending to bash on Microsoft, even though they surely deserve it for the bad things they have done to the Linux community in the past but I’m not interested in getting the final word either. I am now as before, a pragmatist and will use the right tools for the right job and at the right cost.</p>

<p>How things have changed though, now Microsoft ‘loves Linux’ and if we don’t want to believe that, Azure it is said hosts over 60% Linux based servers and applications. On a recent project I’ve worked on, dotnet core developers were delivering C# code compiled on Linux based pipelines and hosted as Linux web applications. The ‘dotnet core’ application platform they inform me is moving further away from traditional .NET than ever before, soon to have little or no backwards compatibility with it’s Windows roots.</p>

<p>At a recent Microsoft training event that I attended we were presented for a whole day with tools hosted on Azure that are wholly Linux based solutions, Kubernetes, Docker, I even saw a Microsoft person using Vim.</p>

<p>And I could go on. It would seem that the recent turn around of Microsoft’s financial status would coincide with their new direction and possibly new CEO Satya Nadella who took over from Steve Ballmer in 2014. I wonder what Steve and Bill think of what he’s done and if they’ve changed their minds on certain things now ?</p>
