# Corona 19

Perhaps the worst viral outbreak since so called Spanish Flu of the post first world war era has reared its ugly head and torn through everyones lives, families, life styles, welfare and our very existence.

What will this mean for us now and in the future, we will only know in time but for certain, we should never go back to the way of doing things before the virus outbreak as if nothing ever happened, assuming a business as normal approach. Nothing will be the same again.
